# Anomaly-Detection: The Dense Sub-Tensor Way

**M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom)** is algorithm for detecting dense subtensors:
 * *scalable*: scales almost linearly with all input factors
 * *provably accurate*: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
 * *flexible*: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-subtensor detection, and size
