M-Zoom (Multidimensional Zoom) and M-Biz (Multidimensional Bi-directional Zoom) are algorithms for detecting dense subtensors. 
They have the following properties: 
- scalable: scales almost linearly with all input factors
- provably accurate: provides high accuracy in real data as well as theoretical guarantees
- flexible: supports high-order tensors, various density measures, multi-subtensor detection, and size bounds
